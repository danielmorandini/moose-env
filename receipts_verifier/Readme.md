## Usage

I leave the rsa keys here for now, I now that is not a good practise but for testing it's better to keep them here in order to be faster.  

* Use `rsaKeysGenerator` to generate the 2 keys, one used by the tool and the other one by the server when creating a receipt
  * Be aware that if you run this you have to subsitute the keys here and in the server/api/v1
  * *this feature will be removed when we're done with testing*    
     
* When a user receives a receipt, he has to copy the whole json and bring it to the stock_taker when he wants to get this stuff
* The stock taker has to put the json inside source.json and run `moose_receipts`
    
* The item will be desripted and you'll see if the signature is accepted    
    
**Done**
